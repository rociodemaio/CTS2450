            " Using protection, in all scenarios, is so important, especially when I'm dealing with these super hairy dogs. This is Mozart the German Shepherd, and guys, when I tell you that I've literally gone home and coughed up a hairball before, it's no joke. In the amount of times where I've barbarically dug into my eyes because there's a hair like in the upper right corner of my eye, I swear it's always the upper right corner. My dog Raikou loves to swim in all the hair, and he just got a bath today. I pat Mozart down with the secret sauce to help loosen his undercoat. I did already use a de-shed shampoo and conditioner in the bathtub, but the whole point of that is so it loosens the hair so then I can use my tools to get it out. Mozart seems to really enjoy that too. But one thing he doesn't enjoy is his ears being cleaned. I feel like so many German Shepherds are just sensitive around their ears, so it's understandable. He is seriously the sweetest Shepherd ever though, so I had to introduce him to Raikou. Hugs all around, and he's all done. Bye Mozart!\n"
